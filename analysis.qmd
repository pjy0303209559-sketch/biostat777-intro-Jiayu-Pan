::: {.callout-tip title="💡 Research Question"}
This analysis explores **how the popularity of Taylor Swift’s music on Spotify changes over time**.
I examine differences across albums and investigate whether audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, valence) 
are related to how well songs are received. 🎧✨
:::


::: {.callout-note title="🌟 Key Findings"}
My results show that **Taylor’s overall album popularity has increased throughout her career**.
Albums such as *1989*, *Folklore*, *Evermore*, and *Midnights* show particularly high popularity scores.
This trend suggests ongoing evolution in musical style, storytelling, and cultural influence. 💗

::: {.margin}
🎧 *Fun Fact:*  
Spotify’s popularity score reflects **recent listening activity**, not just total streams.  
So a song gains popularity if it is being listened to *now*, not only historically.

In summary, this analysis shows a clear upward trend in Taylor Swift’s album-level popularity on Spotify over time. Earlier albums generally have lower popularity scores, while her more recent releases display significantly higher engagement among listeners. The relationships between audio features and popularity suggest that changes in energy, valence, and acousticness may play a role in shaping audience response. These patterns highlight Taylor’s ability to continually adapt her sound and storytelling to resonate with listeners. Overall, the findings illustrate both artistic evolution and shifting listener preferences across different eras of her music. ✨🎤
