I examine differences across albums and investigate whether audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, valence) are related to how well songs are received. 🎧✨\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🌟 Key Findings\n\n\n\nMy results show that Taylor’s overall album popularity has increased throughout her career. Albums such as 1989, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights show particularly high popularity scores. This trend suggests ongoing evolution in musical style, storytelling, and cultural influence. 💗\n\n\n\n🎧 Fun Fact:\nSpotify’s popularity score reflects recent listening activity, not just total streams.\nSo a song gains popularity if it is being listened to now, not only historically.\n\nIn summary, this analysis shows a clear upward trend in Taylor Swift’s album-level popularity on Spotify over time. Earlier albums generally have lower popularity scores, while her more recent releases display significantly higher engagement among listeners. The relationships between audio features and popularity suggest that changes in energy, valence, and acousticness may play a role in shaping audience response. These patterns highlight Taylor’s ability to continually adapt her sound and storytelling to resonate with listeners. Overall, the findings illustrate both artistic evolution and shifting listener preferences across different eras of her music. ✨🎤\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nPackage\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nselect()\ndplyr\nSelects the variables used in the analysis\n\n\nmutate()\ndplyr\nCreates or transforms variables (e.g., release_year)\n\n\nyear()\nlubridate\nExtracts the year from the release date\n\n\ndrop_na()\ntidyr\nRemoves rows with missing values\n\n\ngroup_by()\ndplyr\nGroups data by album and year\n\n\nsummarize()\ndplyr\nComputes average values for selected audio features\n\n\narrange()\ndplyr\nSorts results (e.g., by release year)\n\n\npivot_longer()\ntidyr\nReshapes data for faceting or additional visualizations\n\n\nggplot()\nggplot2\nInitializes a plot object\n\n\ngeom_line()\nggplot2\nPlots lines showing trend over time\n\n\ngeom_point()\nggplot2\nAdds points to highlight individual album averages\n\n\ngeom_col()\nggplot2\nCreates bar plots for comparing album averages\n\n\ngeom_smooth()\nggplot2\nAdds trend lines (optional smoothing)\n\n\nfacet_wrap()\nggplot2\nCreates separate panels for visual comparison\n\n\nlabs()\nggplot2\nAdds titles, axis labels, and captions\n\n\ntheme_minimal()\nggplot2\nApplies a minimal theme to reduce visual clutter\n\n\ntheme_classic()\nggplot2\nRemoves grid lines and applies a clean axis layout"
