About me:



I completed my undergraduate studies in Biochemistry and Pharmacology at **China Pharmaceutical University**, where I spent the first three years building a strong foundation in life sciences and experimental techniques.  
In my final year, I studied at the **University of Strathclyde** in the United Kingdom, which greatly broadened my academic perspective and research experience.

Through my studies and research, I developed a deep interest in **Cancer immunology**.
